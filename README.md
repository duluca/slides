# Future of JavaScript: ECMAScript Harmony

This is a slightly edited version of the slides for my presentation on meet.js summit in Gda≈Ñsk, 19.10.2013. Apart from fixing minor issues with some examples, I added a small section for default parameter values that I didn't have time for during the presentation.
